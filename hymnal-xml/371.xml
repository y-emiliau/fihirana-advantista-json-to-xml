    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>Lift Him up, ’tis He that bids you,<br/>Let the dying look and live;<br/>To all weary, thirsting sinners,<br/>Living waters will He give;<br/>And though once so meek and lowly,<br/>Yet the Prince of heaven was He;<br/>And the blind, who grope in darkness,<br/>Through the blood of Christ shall see.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="c1">
      <lines>Lift Him up, the risen Savior,<br/>High amid the waiting throng;<br/>Lift Him up, ’tis He that speaketh,<br/>Now He bids you flee from wrong.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>Lift Him up, this precious Savior,<br/>Let the multitude behold;<br/>They with willing hearts shall seek Him,<br/>He will draw them to His fold;<br/>They shall gather from the wayside,<br/>Hastening on with joyous feet,<br/>They shall bear the cross of Jesus,<br/>And shall find salvation sweet.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines>Lift Him up in all His glory,<br/>‘Tis the Son of God on high;<br/>Lift Him up, His love shall draw them,<br/>Eén the careless shall draw nigh;<br/>Let them hear again the story<br/>Of the cross, the death of shame;<br/>And from tongue to tongue repeat it;<br/>Mighty throngs shall bless His name.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v4">
      <lines>O then lift Him up in singing,<br/>Lift the Savior up in prayer;<br/>He, the glorious Redeemer,<br/>All the sins of men did bear;<br/>Yes, the young shall bow before Him,<br/>And the old their voices raise;<br/>All the deaf shall hear hosannah;<br/>And the dumb shall shout His praise.</lines>
