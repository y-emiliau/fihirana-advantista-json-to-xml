    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>I will early seek the Savior,<br/>I will learn of Him each day;<br/>I will follow in His footsteps,<br/>I will walk the narrow way.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="c1">
      <lines>For He loves me, yes, He loves me,<br/>Jesus loves me, this I know.<br/>Jesus loves me, died to save me,<br/>This is why I love Him so.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>I will hasten where He bids me,<br/>I am not too young to go<br/>In the pathway where He leadeth,<br/>Not too young His will to know.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines>He is standing at the doorway<br/>Of escape from every sin;<br/>I will knock, for He has promised,<br/>He will hear and let me in.</lines>
