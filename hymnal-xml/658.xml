    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>Heav’nly Father, hear our prayer<br/>As we bow before You:<br/>Bless them in the life they share,<br/>Humble we implore You.<br/>Be their guide in all endeavors,<br/>Be their hope that nothing severs;<br/>Constant source of love divine,<br/>Let Your love within them shine!</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>As they pledge their love this day<br/>Here before Your altar,<br/>May their hearts,, upon You stayed,<br/>Never fail or falter.<br/>Be their comfort in all sorrow;<br/>Be their reason for tomorrow.<br/>Grant them strength to live each hour<br/>Trusting solely in Your pow’r.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines>Blest Creator, Lord of life,<br/>Hear our glad thanksgiving.<br/>Husband You have joined to wife<br/>For their earthly living.<br/>Justified by Jesus’ merit,<br/>Life eternal they inherit.<br/>When their days on earth have passed,<br/>Take them to Your home at last!</lines>
