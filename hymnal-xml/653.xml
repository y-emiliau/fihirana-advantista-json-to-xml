    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>Lead them, my God, to Thee, Lead them to Thee,<br/>These children dear of mine, Thou gavest me;<br/>O, by Thy love divine, Lead them, my God, to Thee;<br/>Lead them, my God, to Thee, Lead them to Thee.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>When earth looks bright and fair, Festive and gay,<br/>Let no delusive snare Lure them astray;<br/>But from temptation’s power, Lead them, my God, to Thee,<br/>Lead them, my God, to Thee, Lead them to Thee.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines>E’en for such little ones, Christ came a child,<br/>And in this world of sin Lived undefiled.<br/>O, for His sake, I pray, Lead them, my God, to Thee,<br/>Lead them, my God, to Thee, Lead them to Thee.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v4">
      <lines>Yea, though my faith be dim, I would believe<br/>That Thou this precious gift Wilt now receive;<br/>O take their young hearts now, Lead them my God to Thee,<br/>Lead them, my God, to Thee, Lead them to Thee.</lines>
