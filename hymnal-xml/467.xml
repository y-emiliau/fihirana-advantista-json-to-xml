    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>Life is great! So sing about it,<br/>As we can and as we should-<br/>Shop and buses, towns and people,<br/>Village, farmland, field and wood,<br/>Life is great and life is given;<br/>Life is lovely, free and good.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>Life is great! What ever happens,<br/>Snow or sunshine, joy or pain,<br/>Hardship, grief or disillusion,<br/>Suffering that I can’t explain<br/>Life is great if someone loves me,<br/>Holds my hand and calls my name.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines>Love is great! The love of lovers,<br/>Whispered words and longing eyes;<br/>Love that gazes at the cradle<br/>Where a child of loving lies;<br/>Love that lasts when youth has faded,<br/>Bends with age, but never dies.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v4">
      <lines>Love is giving and receiving<br/>Boy and girl, or friend with friend;<br/>Love is bearing and forgiving<br/>All the hurts that hate can send;<br/>Love’s the greatest way of living,<br/>Hoping, trusting to the end.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v5">
      <lines>God is great! in Christ He loved us,<br/>As we should, but never can-<br/>Love that suffered, hoped and trusted<br/>When disciples turned and ran,<br/>Love that broke through death forever.<br/>Praise that loving, living Man!</lines>
