    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>Mine eyes have seen the glory<br/>of the coming of the Lord;<br/>He is trampling out the vintage<br/>where the grapes of wrath are stored;<br/>He has loosed the fateful lightning<br/>of His terrible swift sword;<br/>His truth is marching on.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="c1">
      <lines>Glory! Glory! Hallelujah!<br/>Glory! Glory! Hallelujah!<br/>Glory! Glory! Hallelujah!<br/>His truth is marching on.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>He has sounded forth the trumpet<br/>that shall never call retreat;<br/>He is sifting out the hearts of men<br/>before His judgment seat;<br/>O be swift, my soul, to answer Him!<br/>be jubilant, my feet!<br/>Our God is marching on.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines>In the beauty of the lilies<br/>Christ was born across the sea,<br/>With a glory in His bosom<br/>that transfigures you and me;<br/>As He died to make men holy,<br/>let us live to make men free!<br/>While God is marching on.</lines>
