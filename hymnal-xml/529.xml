    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>Under His wings I am safely abiding;<br/>Though the night deepens and tempests are wild,<br/>Still I can trust Him; I know He will keep me;<br/>he has redeemed me, and I am His child.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="c1">
      <lines>Under His wings, under His wings,<br/>Who from His love can sever?<br/>Under His wings, my soul shall abide,<br/>Safely abide forever.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>Under His wings, what a refuge in sorrow!<br/>How the heart yearningly turns to its rest!<br/>Often when earth has no balm for my healing,<br/>There I find comfort, and there I am blest.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines>Under His wings, O what precious enjoyment!<br/>There will I hide till life’s trials are over;<br/>Sheltered, protected, no evil can harm me;<br/>Resting in Jesus I’m safe evermore.</lines>
    </verse>
