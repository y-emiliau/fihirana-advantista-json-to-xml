    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>My Father is rich in houses and lands,<br/>He holdeth the wealth of the world in His hands!<br/>Of rubies and diamonds, of silver and gold,<br/>His coffers are full, He has riches untold.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="c1">
      <lines>I’m a child of the King,<br/>A child of the King:<br/>With Jesus my Savior,<br/>I’m a child of the King.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>My Father’s own Son, the Savior of men,<br/>Once wandered on earth as the poorest of them;<br/>But now He is pleading our pardon on high,<br/>That we may be His when He comes by and by.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines>I once was an outcast stranger on earth,<br/>A sinner by choice, an alien by birth,<br/>But I’ve been adopted, my name’s written down,<br/>An heir to a mansion, a robe and a crown.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v4">
      <lines>A tent or a cottage, why should I care?<br/>They’re building a palace for me over there;<br/>Though exiled from home, yet still may I sing:<br/>All glory to God, I’m a child of the King.</lines>
    </verse>
