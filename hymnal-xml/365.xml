    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>O Zion, haste, thy mission high fulfilling,<br/>to tell to all the world that God is light,<br/>that he who made all nations is not willing<br/>one soul should perish, lost in shades of night.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="c1">
      <lines>Publish glad tidings, tidings of peace;<br/>tidings of Jesus, redemption and release.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>Proclaim to every people, tongue, and nation<br/>that God, in whom they live and move, is love;<br/>tell how he stooped to save his lost creation,<br/>and died on earth that we might live above.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines>Give of thine own to bear the message glorious;<br/>give of thy wealth to speed them on their way;<br/>pour out thy soul for them in prayer victorious;<br/>O Zion, haste to bring the brighter day.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v4">
      <lines>He comes again; O Zion, ere thou meet Him,<br/>Make known to every heart His saving grace;<br/>Let none whom He hath ransomed fail to greet Him,<br/>Through thy neglect, unfit to see His face.</lines>
    </verse>
