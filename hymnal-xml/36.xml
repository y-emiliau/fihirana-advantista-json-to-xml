    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>O Thou in whose presence my soul takes delight,<br/>On whom in affliction I call,<br/>My comfort by day and my song in the night,<br/>My hope, my salvation, my all!</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>His voice, as the sound of the dulcimer sweet,<br/>Is heard through the shadows of death;<br/>The cedars of Lebanon bow at His feet,<br/>The air is perfumed with His breath.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines>His lips, as a fountain of righteousness flow,<br/>To water the gardens of grace;<br/>From which their salvation the Gentiles shall know,<br/>And bask in the smiles of His face.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v4">
      <lines>He looks, and ten thousands of angels rejoice,<br/>And myriads wait for His word;<br/>He speaks, and eternity, filled with His voice,<br/>Re-echoes the praise of the Lord.</lines>
    </verse>
