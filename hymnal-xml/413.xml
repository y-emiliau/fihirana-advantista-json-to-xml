    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>God has spoken by His prophets,<br/>Spoken His unchanging Word,<br/>Each from age to age proclaiming<br/>God, the one, the righteous Lord.<br/>Mid the world’s despair and turmoil,<br/>One firm anchor holding fast;<br/>God is King, His throne eternal,<br/>God the first, and God the last.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>God has spoken by Christ Jesus,<br/>Christ, the everlasting Son,<br/>Brightness of the Father’s glory,<br/>With the Father ever one;<br/>Spoken by the Word incarnate,<br/>God of God, ere time began,<br/>Light of light, to earth descending,<br/>Man, revealing God to man.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines>God yet speaks by His own Spirit<br/>Speaking to the hearts of men,<br/>In the age-long Word expounding<br/>God’s own message, now as then;<br/>Through the rise and fall of nations<br/>One sure faith yet standing fast,<br/>God is King, His Word unchanging,<br/>God the first, and God the last.</lines>
