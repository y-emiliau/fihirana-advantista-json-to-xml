    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>The first noel the angel did say<br/>Was to certain poor shepherds<br/>in fields where they lay;<br/>In fields where they lay<br/>keeping their sheep,<br/>On a cold winter’s night<br/>that was so deep.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="c1">
      <lines>Noel, Noel, Noel, Noel,<br/>Born is the King of Israel</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>They looked up and say a star<br/>Shining in the east, beyond them far,<br/>And to the earth it gave great light,<br/>And so it continued both day and night.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines>And by the light of that same star,<br/>Three wise men came from country far,<br/>And to the earth it gave great light,<br/>And to follow the star wherever it went.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v4">
      <lines>This star drew nigh to the northwest,<br/>O’er Bethlehem it took its rest,<br/>And there it did both stop and stay,<br/>Right over the place where Jesus lay.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v5">
      <lines>Then entered in those wise men three,<br/>Full reverently upon the knee,<br/>And offered there, in His presence,<br/>Their gold, and myrrh, and frankincense.</lines>
    </verse>
