    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>Jesus, I my cross have taken,<br/>all to leave and follow Thee.<br/>All things else I have forsaken,<br/>Thou from hence my all shall be.<br/>Perish every fond ambition,<br/>all I’ve sought or hoped or known.<br/>Yet how rich is my condition!<br/>God and Heaven are still mine own.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>Let the world despise and leave me,<br/>they have left my Savior, too.<br/>Human hearts and looks deceive me;<br/>Thou art faithful, Thou art true.<br/>O, ‘tis not in grief to harm me,<br/>while thy love is left to me;<br/>O, ‘twere not in joy to charm me,<br/>If that love be hid from me.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines>Soul, then know thy full salvation;<br/>rise o’er sin, and fear, and care;<br/>Joy to find in every station<br/>something still to do or bear:<br/>Think what Spirit dwells within thee;<br/>Think what Father’s smiles are thine;<br/>Think that Jesus died to win thee,<br/>child of heaven, canst thou repine?</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v4">
      <lines>Haste then on from grace to glory,<br/>armed by faith, and winged by prayer,<br/>Heaven’s eternal day’s before thee,<br/>God’s own hand shall guide thee there.<br/>Soon shall close thy earthly mission,<br/>soon shall pass thy pilgrim days;<br/>Hope soon change to glad fruition,<br/>faith to sight, and prayer to praise.</lines>
