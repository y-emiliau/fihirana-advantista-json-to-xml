    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>I think when I read that sweet story of old,<br/>When Jesus was here among men,<br/>How He called little children as lambs to His fold,<br/>I should like to have been with Him then.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>I wish that His hands had been placed on my head,<br/>That His arm had been thrown around me,<br/>And that I might have seen His kind look when He said,<br/>“Let the little ones come unto Me.”</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines>I long for the joy of that glorious time,<br/>The sweetest and brightest and best,<br/>When the dear little children of every clime<br/>Shall crowd to His arms and be blest.</lines>
