      <lines>Just when I need Him, Jesus is near,<br/>Just when I falter, just when I fear;<br/>Ready to help me, ready to cheer,<br/>Just when I need Him most.<br/>Just when I need Him most,<br/>Just when I need Him most,<br/>Jesus is near to comfort and cheer,<br/>Just when I need Him most.</lines>

    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>Just when I need Him, Jesus is true,<br/>Never forsaking, all the way through,<br/>Giving for burdens pleasures anew,<br/>Just when I need Him most.<br/>Just when I need Him most,<br/>Just when I need Him most,<br/>Jesus is near to comfort and cheer,<br/>Just when I need Him most.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines>Just when I need Him, Jesus is strong,<br/>Bearing my burdens all the day long;<br/>For all my sorrow giving a song,<br/>Just when I need Him most.<br/>Just when I need Him most,<br/>Just when I need Him most,<br/>Jesus is near to comfort and cheer,<br/>Just when I need Him most.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v4">
      <lines>Just when I need Him, He is my all,<br/>Answering when upon Him I call;<br/>Tenderly watching lest I should fall,<br/>Just when I need Him most.<br/>Just when I need Him most,<br/>Just when I need Him most,<br/>Jesus is near to comfort and cheer,<br/>Just when I need Him most.</lines>
