    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>There is singing up in heaven<br/>such as we have never known,<br/>Where the angels sing the praises<br/>of the Lamb upon the throne;<br/>Their sweet harps are ever tuneful<br/>and their voices are always clear,<br/>O that we might be more like them<br/>while we serve the Master here!</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="c1">
      <lines>Holy, holy, is what the angels sing,<br/>And I expect to help them make<br/>the courts of heaven ring;<br/>But when I sing redemption’s story,<br/>they will fold their wings,<br/>For angels never felt the joys<br/>that our salvation brings.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>But I hear another anthem,<br/>blending voices clear and strong,<br/>“Unto Him who hath redeemed us<br/>and hath bought us,” is the song;<br/>We have come thro’ tribulations<br/>to this land so fair and bright,<br/>In the fountain freely flowing<br/>He hath made our garments white.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines>Then the angels stand and listen,<br/>for they cannot join that song,<br/>Like the sound of many waters,<br/>by that happy, blood-washed throng;<br/>For they sing about great trials,<br/>battles fought and vict’ries won,<br/>And they praised the great Redeemer,<br/>who hath said to them, “Well done.”</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v4">
      <lines>So, although I’m not an angel,<br/>yet I know that over there<br/>I will join a blessed chorus<br/>that the angels cannot share;<br/>I will sing about my Savior,<br/>who upon dark Calvary<br/>Freely pardoned my transgressions,<br/>died to set the sinner free.</lines>
