    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>God is here as we his people<br/>meet to offer praise and prayer,<br/>may we find in fuller measure<br/>what it is in Christ we share.<br/>Here, as in the world around us,<br/>all our varied skills and arts<br/>wait the coming of his Spirit<br/>into open minds and hearts.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>Here are symbols to remind us<br/>of our lifelong need of grace;<br/>here are table, font and pulpit;<br/>here the Word has central place.<br/>Here in honesty of preaching,<br/>here in silence, as in speech,<br/>here in newness and renewal,<br/>God the Spirit comes to each.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines>Here our children find a welcome<br/>in the Shepherd’s flock and fold.<br/>Here, as bread and wine are taken,<br/>Christ sustains us, as of old.<br/>Here the servants of the Servant<br/>seek in worship to explore<br/>what it means in daily living<br/>to believe and to adore.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v4">
      <lines>Lord of all, Church and Kingdom,<br/>in an age of change and doubt,<br/>keep us faithful to the Gospel,<br/>help us work your purpose out.<br/>Here, in this day’s dedication,<br/>all we have to give, receive:<br/>we, who cannot live without you,<br/>we adore you! We believe!</lines>
