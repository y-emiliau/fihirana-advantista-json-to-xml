    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>O God from whom mankind derives its name;<br/>Whose covenant of grace remains the same,<br/>Be with these two who now before You wait;<br/>Enlarge the love they come to consecrate.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>May through their union other lives be blessed;<br/>Their door be wide to stranger and to guest,<br/>Give them the understanding that is kind,<br/>Grant them the blessing of an open mind.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines>Preserve their days from inwardness of hear;<br/>To each the gift of truthful speech impart.<br/>Their bond be strong against all strain and strife<br/>Amid the changes of this earthly life.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v4">
      <lines>From stage to stage on lifeâ€™s unfolding way<br/>Bring to their mind the vows they make this day,<br/>Your Spirit be their Guide in every move,<br/>Their faith in Christ the basis of their love.</lines>
    </verse>
