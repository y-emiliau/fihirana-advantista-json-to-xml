    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>Tell out, my soul, the greatness of His name:<br/>Make known His might, the deeds His arm has done;<br/>His mercy sure, from age to age the same;<br/>His holy name, the Lord, the Mighty One.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines>Tell out, my soul, the greatness of His might:<br/>Pow’rs and dominions lay their glory by;<br/>Proud hearts and stubborn wills are put to flight,<br/>The hungry fed, the humble lifted high.</lines>

    <verse name="v4">
      <lines>Tell out, my soul, the glories of His word:<br/>Firm is His promise, and His mercy sure.<br/>Tell out, my soul, the greatness of the Lord<br/>To children’s children and forevermore.</lines>
