    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>My Father is omnipotent<br/>And that you can’t deny;<br/>A God of might and miracles;<br/>‘Tis written in the sky.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="c1">
      <lines>It took a miracle to put the stars in place;<br/>It took a miracle to hang the world in space.<br/>But when He saved my soul,<br/>Cleansed and made me whole,<br/>It took a miracle of love and grace!</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>Though here His glory has been shown,<br/>We still can’t fully see<br/>The wonders of His might, His throne;<br/>‘Till eternity.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines>The Bible tells us of His power<br/>And wisdom all way through;<br/>And every little bird and flower<br/>Are testimonies, too.</lines>
