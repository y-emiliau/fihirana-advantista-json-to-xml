    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>Chief of sinners though I be,<br/>Jesus shed His blood for me;<br/>Died that I might live on high,<br/>Died that I might never die;<br/>As the brance is to the vine,<br/>I am His, and He is mine.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>O the height of Jesusâ€™ love!<br/>Higher than the heaven above,<br/>Deeper than the deepest sea,<br/>Lasting as eternity;<br/>Love that found me-wondrous thought!<br/>Found me when I sought Him not!</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines>Chief of sinners though I be,<br/>Christ is all in all to me;<br/>All my wants to Him are known,<br/>All my sorrows are His own;<br/>Safe with Him from earthly strife,<br/>He sustains the hidden life.</lines>
