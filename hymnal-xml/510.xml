    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>If you but trust in God to guide you<br/>And place your confidence in Him,<br/>You’ll find Him always there beside you,<br/>To give you hope and strength within.<br/>For those who trust God’s changeless love<br/>Build on the rock that will not move.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>What gain is there in futile weeping,<br/>In helpless anger and distress?<br/>If you are in His care and keeping,<br/>In sorrow will He love you less?<br/>For He who took for you a cross<br/>Will bring you safe through every loss.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines>In patient trust await His leisure<br/>In cheerful hope, with heart content<br/>To take whate’er your Father’s pleasure<br/>And all discerning love have sent;<br/>Doubt not your inmost wants are known<br/>To Him who chose you for His own.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v4">
      <lines>Sing, pray, and keep His ways unswerving,<br/>Offer your service faithfully,<br/>And trust His word; though undeserving,<br/>You’ll find His promise true to be.<br/>God never will forsake in need<br/>The soul that trusts in Him indeed.</lines>
    </verse>
