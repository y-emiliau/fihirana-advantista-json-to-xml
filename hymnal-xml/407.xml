    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>Sent forth by God’s blessing,<br/>Our true faith confessing,<br/>The people of God from His dwelling take leave.<br/>The supper is ended.<br/>Oh, now be extended<br/>The fruits of this service in all who believe.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>The seed of His teaching,<br/>Receptive souls reaching,<br/>Shall blossom in action for God and for all.<br/>His grace did invite us,<br/>His love shall unite us<br/>To work for God’s kingdom and answer His call.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines>With praise and thanksgiving<br/>To God ever living,<br/>The tasks of our everyday life we will face.<br/>Our faith ever sharing,<br/>In love ever caring,<br/>Embracing His children of each tribe and race.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v4">
      <lines>With Your feast You feed us,<br/>With Your light now lead us;<br/>Unite us as one in this life that we share.<br/>Then may all the living<br/>With praise and thanks giving<br/>Give honor to Christ and His name that we bear.</lines>
