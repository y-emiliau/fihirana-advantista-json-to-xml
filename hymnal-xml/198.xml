    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>And can it be that I should gain<br/>an interest in the Savior’s blood!<br/>Died he for me? who caused his pain!<br/>For me? who him to death pursued?<br/>Amazing love! How can it be<br/>that thou, my God, shouldst die for me?</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="c1">
      <lines>Amazing love! How can it be<br/>that thou, my God, shouldst die for me?</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>He left his Father’s throne above<br/>so free, so infinite his grace!;<br/>emptied himself of all but love,<br/>and bled for Adam’s helpless race.<br/>‘Tis mercy all, immense and free,<br/>for O my God, it found out me!</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines>Long my imprisoned sprit lay,<br/>fast bound in sin and nature’s night;<br/>thine eye diffused a quickening ray;<br/>I woke, the dungeon flamed with light;<br/>my chains fell off, my heart was free,<br/>I rose, went forth, and followed thee.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v4">
      <lines>No condemnation now I dread;<br/>Jesus, and all in him, is mine;<br/>alive in him, my living Head,<br/>and clothed in righteousnes divine,<br/>bold I approach th’ eternal throne,<br/>and claim the crown, through Christ my own.</lines>
