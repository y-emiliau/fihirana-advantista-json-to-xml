    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>Alleluia! sing to Jesus!<br/>His the scepter, His the throne.<br/>Alleluia! His the triumph,<br/>His the victory alone.<br/>Hark! the songs of peaceful<br/>Zion thunder like a mighty flood.<br/>Jesus out of every nation<br/>has redeemed us by His blood.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>Alleluia! not as orphans<br/>are we left in sorrow now;<br/>Alleluia! He is near us,<br/>faith believes, nor questions how;<br/>Though the cloud from sight<br/>received Him when the forty days were o’er<br/>Shall our hearts forget His promise,<br/>“I am with you evermore”?</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines>Alleluia! bread of angels,<br/>Thou on earth our food, our stay;<br/>Alleluia! here the sinful flee<br/>to Thee from day to day:<br/>Intercessor, Friend of sinners,<br/>Earth’s Redeemer, plead for me,<br/>Where the songs of all the sinless<br/>sweep across the crystal sea.</lines>
