    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>Sweet hour of prayer! sweet hour of prayer!<br/>that calls me from a world of care,<br/>and bids me at my Father’s throne<br/>make all my wants and wishes known.<br/>In seasons of distress and grief,<br/>my soul has often found relief,<br/>and oft escaped the tempter’s snare<br/>by thy return, sweet hour of prayer!</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>Sweet hour of prayer! sweet hour of prayer!<br/>thy wings shall my petition bear<br/>to him whose truth and faithfulness<br/>engage the waiting soul to bless.<br/>And since he bids me seek his face,<br/>believe his word, and trust his grace,<br/>I’ll cast on him my every care,<br/>and wait for thee, sweet hour of prayer!</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines>Sweet hour of prayer! sweet hour of prayer!<br/>May I thy consolation share<br/>Till from Mount Pisgah’s lofty height<br/>I view my home and take my flight.<br/>In my immortal flesh I’ll rise<br/>To size the everlasting prize.<br/>And shout while passing through the air,<br/>“Farewell, farewell, sweet hour of prayer!”</lines>
