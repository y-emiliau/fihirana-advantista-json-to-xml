    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>Praise, my soul, the King of heaven;<br/>To his feet thy tribute bring;<br/>Ransomed, healed, restored, forgiven,<br/>Who like thee His praise should sing?<br/>Praise Him, praise Him, alleluia!<br/>Praise the everlasting King.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>Praise him for his grace and favor<br/>To our fathers in distress;<br/>Praise him still the same forever,<br/>Slow to chide and swift to bless:<br/>Praise Him, praise Him, alleluia!<br/>Glorious in His faithfulness.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines>Tenderly He shields and spares us;<br/>Well our feeble frame he knows;<br/>In his hands He gently bears us,<br/>Rescues us from all our foes.<br/>Praise Him, praise Him, alleluia!<br/>Widely yet his mercy flows.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v4">
      <lines>Angels, help us to adore him;<br/>Ye behold him face to face;<br/>Sun and moon, bow down before him,<br/>Dwellers all in time and space.<br/>Praise Him, praise Him, alleluia!<br/>Praise with us the God of grace.</lines>
    </verse>
