    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>Angels from the realms of glory,<br/>Wing your flight o`er all the earth;<br/>Ye, who sang creation`s story,<br/>Now proclaim Messiah`s birth;<br/>Come and worship, Come and worship,<br/>Worship Christ, the newborn King.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>Shepherds, in the field abiding,<br/>Watching o`er your flocks by night,<br/>God with man is now residing;<br/>Yonder shines the Infant Light;<br/>Come and worship, Come and worship,<br/>Worship Christ, the newborn King.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines>Sages, leave your contemplations,<br/>Brighter visions beam afar;<br/>Seek the great Desire of nations;<br/>Ye have seen His natal star;<br/>Come and worship, Come and worship,<br/>Worship Christ, the newborn King.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v4">
      <lines>Saints, before the altar bending,<br/>Watching long in hope and fear,<br/>Suddenly the Lord, descending,<br/>In His temple shall appear;<br/>Come and worship, Come and worship,<br/>Worship Christ, the newborn King.</lines>
