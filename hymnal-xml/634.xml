    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>Come, all Christians, be committed<br/>To the service of the lord;<br/>Make your lives for him more fitted,<br/>Tune your hearts with one accord.<br/>Come into His courts with gladness,<br/>Each his sacred vows renew,<br/>Turn away from sin and sadness,<br/>Be transformed with life anew.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>Of your time and talents give ye,<br/>They are gifts from God above;<br/>To be used by Christians freely<br/>To proclaim His wondrous love.<br/>Come again to serve the Savior,<br/>Tithes and off’rings with you bring.<br/>In your work, with Him find favor,<br/>And with joy His praises sing.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines>God’s command to love each other<br/>Is required of every one;<br/>Showing mercy to one another<br/>Mirrors His redemptive plan.<br/>In compassion He has given<br/>Of His love that is divine;<br/>On the cross sins were forgiven;<br/>Joy and peace are fully thine.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v4">
      <lines>Come in praise and adoration,<br/>All who in Christ’s name believe;<br/>Worship Him with consecration,<br/>Grace and love you will receive.<br/>For His grace give Him the glory,<br/>For the Spirit and the Word,<br/>And repeat the gospel story<br/>Till mankind His name has heard.</lines>
