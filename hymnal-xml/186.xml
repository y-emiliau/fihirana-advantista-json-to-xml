    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>I’ve found a Friend; oh, such a Friend!<br/>He loved me ere I knew Him;<br/>He drew me with the cords of love,<br/>And thus He bound me to Him.<br/>And ’round my heart still closely twine<br/>Those ties which nought can sever,<br/>For I am His, and He is mine,<br/>Forever and forever.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>I’ve found a Friend; oh, such a Friend!<br/>He bled, He died to save me;<br/>And not alone the gift of life,<br/>But His own self He gave me.<br/>Nought that I have my own I call,<br/>I hold it for the Giver;<br/>My heart, my strength, my life my all,<br/>Are His, and His forever.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines>I’ve found a Friend; oh, such a Friend!<br/>All power to Him is given;<br/>To guard me on my upward course,<br/>And bring me safe to heaven.<br/>The eternal glories gleam afar,<br/>To nerve my faint endeavor;<br/>So now to watch, to work, to war,<br/>And then to rest forever.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v4">
      <lines>I’ve found a Friend; oh, such a Friend!<br/>So kind, and true, and tender,<br/>So wise a counselor and guide,<br/>So mighty a defender.<br/>From Him, who loveth me so well,<br/>What power my soul can sever?<br/>Shall life or death, or earth, or hell?<br/>No; I am His forever.</lines>
