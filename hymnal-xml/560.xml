    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>Let all things now living a song of thanksgiving<br/>To God the Creator triumphantly raise,<br/>Who fashioned and made us, protected and stayed us,<br/>Who guideth us on to the end of our days.<br/>His banners are o’er us,<br/>His light goes before us,<br/>A pillar of fire shining forth in the night,<br/>‘Til shadows have vanished and darkness is banished,<br/>as forward we travel from light into light.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>His law He enforces: the stars in their courses,<br/>The sun in His orbit, obediently shine;<br/>The hills and the mountains, the rivers and fountains,<br/>The deeps of the ocean proclaim Him divine,<br/>We too should be voicing our love and rejoicing,<br/>With glad adoration a song let us raise,<br/>‘Til all things now living unite in thanksgiving<br/>To God in the highest, hosanna and praise.</lines>
