    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>The judgment has set, the books have been opened;<br/>How shall we stand in that great day,<br/>When every thought, and word, and action,<br/>God, the righteous Judge, shall weigh?</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="c1">
      <lines>How shall we stand in that great day?<br/>How shall we stand in that great day?<br/>Shall we be found before Him wanting?<br/>Or with our sins all washed away?</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>The work is begun with those who are sleeping,<br/>Soon will the living here be tried,<br/>Out of the books of Godâ€™s remembrance,<br/>His decision to abide.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines>O, how shall we stand that moment of searching,<br/>When all our sins those books reveal?<br/>When from that court, each case decided,<br/>Shall be granted no appeal?</lines>
    </verse>
