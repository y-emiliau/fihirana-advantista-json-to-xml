    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>Day by day, and with each passing moment,<br/>Strength I find, to meet my trials here;<br/>Trusting in my Father’s wise bestowment,<br/>I’ve no cause for worry or for fear.<br/>He Whose heart is kind beyond all measure<br/>Gives unto each day what He deems best—<br/>Lovingly, its part of pain and pleasure,<br/>Mingling toil with peace and rest.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>Every day, the Lord Himself is near me<br/>With a special mercy for each hour;<br/>All my cares He fain would bear, and cheer me,<br/>He Whose Name is Counselor and Power;<br/>The protection of His child and treasure<br/>Is a charge that on Himself He laid;<br/>“As thy days, thy strength shall be in measure,”<br/>This the pledge to me He made.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines>Help me then in every tribulation<br/>So to trust Thy promises, O Lord,<br/>That I lose not faith’s sweet consolation<br/>Offered me within Thy holy Word.<br/>Help me, Lord, when toil and trouble meeting,<br/>Ever to take, as from a father’s hand,<br/>One by one, the days, the moments fleeting,<br/>Till I reach the promised land.</lines>
