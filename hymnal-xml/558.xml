    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>For the fruits of His creation, thanks be to God;<br/>For the gifts to every nation, thanks be to God;<br/>For the plowing, sowing, reaping,<br/>Silent growth while men are sleeping,<br/>Future needs in earth’s safe keeping, thanks be to God!</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>In the just reward of labor, God’s will is done;<br/>In the hop we give our neighbor, God’s will is done;<br/>In our worldwide take of caring<br/>For the hungry and despairing,<br/>In the harvests men are sharing, God’s will is done.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines>For the harvests of His Spirit, thanks be to God;<br/>For the good all men inherit, thanks be to God;<br/>For the wonders that astound us,<br/>For the truths that still confound us,<br/>Most of all, that love has found us, thanks be to God!</lines>
