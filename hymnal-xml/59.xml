    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>Great our joy as now we gather<br/>Where the Master makes us one:<br/>Where we worship God the Father<br/>Thro’ the Spirit of His Son.<br/>All who search for His church<br/>Find it where His will is done.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>Precious is the tie that binds us<br/>To our God when faith grows cold;<br/>Precious all that now reminds us<br/>He is still our safe stronghold.<br/>Faithful love serves to prove<br/>Here the Shepherd has His fold.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines>May we learn from Christ’s example<br/>How to use this house of prayer:<br/>He who loved and cleansed His temple<br/>Wants us all to worship there.<br/>God the Son shuts out none:<br/>In His kingdom all may share.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v4">
      <lines>Lord, inspire us with Your vision<br/>Of a world which must be won!<br/>Glorious is the church’s mission,<br/>Long endeavoured, scarce begun!<br/>Faithful now - this is how<br/>God’s eternal will is done.</lines>
    </verse>
