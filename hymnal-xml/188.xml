    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>My song is love unknown,<br/>My Savior’s love to me,<br/>Love to the loveless shown,<br/>That they might lovely be.<br/>O who am I that for my sake<br/>My Lord should take frail flesh and die?</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>He came from His blest throne,<br/>Salvation to bestow,<br/>But men made strange, and none<br/>The longed for Christ would know.<br/>But O my Friend, my Friend indeed<br/>Who at my need His life did spend.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines>Sometimes they strew His way,<br/>And His sweet praises sing,<br/>Resounding all the day,<br/>Hosannas to their King.<br/>Then “Crucify” is all their breath,<br/>And for His death they thirst and cry.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v4">
      <lines>Why, what hath my Lord done?<br/>What makes this rage and spite?<br/>He made the lame to run,<br/>He gave the blind their sight.<br/>Sweet injuries! yet they at these<br/>Themselves displease, and ‘gainst Him rise.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v5">
      <lines>They rise, and needs will have<br/>My dear Lord made away;<br/>A murderer they save,<br/>The Prince of life they slay.<br/>Yet cheerful He to suff’ring goes,<br/>That He His foes from thence might free.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v6">
      <lines>Here might I stay and sing,<br/>No story so divine:<br/>Never was love, dear King,<br/>Never was grief like Thine!<br/>This is my Friend, in whose sweet praise<br/>I all my days could gladly spend.</lines>
