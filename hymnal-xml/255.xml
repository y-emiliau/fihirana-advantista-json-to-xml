    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>I cannot tell why<br/>He whom angels worship<br/>Should set His love<br/>upon the souls of men,<br/>Or why as Shepherd<br/>He should seek the wanderers,<br/>To bring them back,<br/>they know not how nor when.<br/>But this I know,<br/>that He was born of Mary<br/>When Bethlehemâ€™s manger<br/>was His only home,<br/>And that He lived<br/>at Nazareth and labored;<br/>And so the Savior,<br/>Savior of the world, has come.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>I cannot tell how<br/>silently He suffered<br/>As with His peace<br/>He graced this place of tears,<br/>Nor how His heart<br/>upon the cross was broken,<br/>The crown of pain<br/>to three and thirty years.<br/>But this I know<br/>He heals the broken hearted<br/>And stays our sin<br/>and calms our lurking fear,<br/>And lifts the burden<br/>from the heavy laden;<br/>For still the Savior,<br/>Savior of the world, is here.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines>I cannot tell how<br/>He will win the nations,<br/>How He will claim<br/>His earthly heritage,<br/>How satisfy the<br/>needs and aspirations<br/>Of east and west,<br/>of sinner and of sage.<br/>But this I know,<br/>all flesh shall see His glory,<br/>And He shall reap<br/>the harvest He has sown,<br/>And some glad day His<br/>sun will shine in splendor<br/>When He the Savior,<br/>Savior, of the world, is known.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v4">
      <lines>I cannot tell how<br/>all lands shall worship,<br/>When at His biding<br/>every storm is stilled,<br/>Or who can say how<br/>great the jubilation<br/>When all our hearts<br/>with love for Him are filled.<br/>But this I know the skies<br/>shall sound His praises,<br/>Ten thousand thousand<br/>human voices sing,<br/>And earth to heaven,<br/>and heaven to earth will answer,<br/>At last the Savior,<br/>Savior of the world, is King!</lines>
