    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>My faith has found a resting place,<br/>Not in a manmade creed;<br/>I trust the ever living One,<br/>That He for me shall plead.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="c1">
      <lines>I need no other evidence,<br/>I need no other plea;<br/>It is enough that Jesus died,<br/>And rose again for me.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>Enough for me that Jesus saves,<br/>This ends my fear and doubt;<br/>A sinful soul, I come to Him,<br/>He will not cast me out.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines>My soul is resting on the Word,<br/>The living Word of God,<br/>Salvation in my Saviorâ€™s name,<br/>Salvation through His blood.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v4">
      <lines>My great Physician heals the sick,<br/>The lost He came to save;<br/>For me His precious blood He shed,<br/>For me His life He gave.</lines>
    </verse>
