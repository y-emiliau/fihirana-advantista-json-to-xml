    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>We speak of the realms of the blest,<br/>That country so bright and so fair,<br/>And oft are its glories confessed-<br/>But what must it be to be there!<br/>We speak of its pathway of gold-<br/>Its walls decked with jewels so rare,<br/>Its wonders and pleasures untold-<br/>But what must it be to be there!</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>We speak of its freedom of sin,<br/>From sorrow, temptation and care,<br/>From trials without and within—<br/>But what must it be to be there!<br/>We speak of its service of love,<br/>Of the robes which glorified wear,<br/>Of the church of the First Born above-<br/>But what must it be to be there!</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines>Our mourning is all at an end,<br/>When, raised by the life-giving word,<br/>We see the new city descend,<br/>Adorned as a bride for her Lord;<br/>The city so holy and clean,<br/>No sorrow can breathe in the air;<br/>No gloom of affliction or sin,<br/>No shadow of evil, is there.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v4">
      <lines>Do Thou, midst temptation and woe,<br/>For heaven my spirit prepare;<br/>And shortly I also so shall know<br/>And feel what it is to be there.<br/>Then o’er the bright fields we shall roam,<br/>In glory celestial and fair,<br/>With saints and with angels at home,<br/>And Jesus Himself will be there.</lines>
