    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>Onward, Christian soldiers, marching as to war,<br/>with the cross of Jesus going on before.<br/>Christ, the royal Master, leads against the foe;<br/>forward into battle see his banners go!</lines>

    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>Like a mighty army moves the church of God;<br/>brothers, we are treading where the saints have trod.<br/>We are not divided, all one body we,<br/>one in hope and doctrine, one in charity.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines>Crowns and thrones my perish, kingdoms rise and wane,<br/>but the church of Jesus constant will remain.<br/>Gates of hell can never ‘gainst that church prevail;<br/>we have Christ’s own promise, and that cannot fail.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v4">
      <lines>Onward then, ye people, join our happy throng,<br/>blend with ours your voices in the triumph song.<br/>Glory, laud, and honor unto Christ the King,<br/>this through countless ages men and angels sing.</lines>
    </verse>
