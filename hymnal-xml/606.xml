    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>Once to every man and nation,<br/>comes the moment to decide,<br/>In the strife of truth with falsehood,<br/>for the good or evil side;<br/>Some great cause, some great decision,<br/>offering each the bloom or blight,<br/>And the choice goes by forever,<br/>’twixt that darkness and that light.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>Then to side with truth is noble,<br/>when we share her wretched crust,<br/>Ere her cause bring fame and profit,<br/>and ’tis prosperous to be just;<br/>Then it is the brave man chooses<br/>while the coward stands aside,<br/>Till the multitude make virtue<br/>of the faith they had denied.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines>By the light of burning martyrs,<br/>Christ, Thy bleeding feet we track,<br/>Toiling up new Calv’ries ever<br/>with the cross that turns not back;<br/>New occasions teach new duties,<br/>time makes ancient good uncouth,<br/>They must upward still and onward,<br/>who would keep abreast of truth.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v4">
      <lines>Though the cause of evil prosper,<br/>yet the truth alone is strong;<br/>Though her portion be the scaffold,<br/>and upon the throne be wrong;<br/>Yet that scaffold sways the future,<br/>and behind the dim unknown,<br/>Standeth God within the shadow,<br/>keeping watch above His own.</lines>
