    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>I have a Friend so precious,<br/>So very dear to me,<br/>He loves me with such tender love,<br/>He loves so faithfully;<br/>I could not live apart form Him,<br/>I love to feel Him nigh,<br/>And so we dwell together,<br/>My Lord and I.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>Sometimes Iâ€™m faint and weary,<br/>He knows that I am weak,<br/>And as He bids me lean on Him,<br/>His help I gladly seek;<br/>He leads me in the paths of light,<br/>Beneath a sunny sky,<br/>And so we walk together,<br/>My Lord and I.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines>I tell Him all my sorrows,<br/>I tell Him all my joys,<br/>I tell Him all that pleases me,<br/>I tell Him what annoys;<br/>He tells me what I ought to do,<br/>He tells me how to try,<br/>And so we talk together,<br/>My Lord and I.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v4">
      <lines>He knows that I am longing<br/>Some weary soul to win,<br/>And so He bids me go and speak<br/>The loving word for Him;<br/>He bids me tell His wondrous love,<br/>And why He came to die,<br/>And so we work together,<br/>My Lord and I.</lines>
