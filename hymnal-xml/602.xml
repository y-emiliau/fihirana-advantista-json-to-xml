    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>O brother be faithful! soon Jesus will come,<br/>For whom we have waited so long;<br/>O, soon we shall enter our glorious home,<br/>And join in the conqueror’s song.<br/>O brother be faithful! for why should we prove<br/>Unfaithful to Him who had shown<br/>Such deep, such unbounded and infinite love<br/>Who died to redeem us His own.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>O brother be faithful! the city of gold,<br/>Prepared for the good and the blest,<br/>Is waiting its portals of pearl to unfold,<br/>And welcome thee into thy rest.<br/>Then, brother be faithful! not long shall we stay<br/>In weariness here, and forlorn,<br/>Time’s dark night of sorrow is wearing away,<br/>We haste to the glorious morn.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines>O brother be faithful! He soon will descend,<br/>Creation’s omnipotent King,<br/>While legions of angels His chariot attend,<br/>And palm wreaths, of victory bring.<br/>O brother be faithful! and soon shalt thou hear<br/>They Savior pronounce the glad word,<br/>Well done, faithful servant, they title is clear,<br/>To enter the joy of thy Lord.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v4">
      <lines>O brother be faithful! eternity’s years<br/>Shall tell for thy faithfulness now,<br/>When bright smiles of gladness shall scatter thy tears,<br/>A coronet gleam on thy brow.<br/>O brother be faithful! the promise is sure,<br/>That waits for the faithful and tried;<br/>To reign with the ransomed, immortal and pure,<br/>And ever with Jesus abide.</lines>
