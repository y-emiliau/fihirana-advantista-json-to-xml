    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>Working, O Christ, with Thee, working with Thee,<br/>Unworthy, sinful, weak, though we may be;<br/>Our all to Thee we give, for Thee alone we live,<br/>And by Thy grace achieve, working with Thee.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>Along the city’s waste, working with Thee,<br/>Our eager footsteps haste, like Thee to be;<br/>The poor we gather in, the outcasts raise from sin,<br/>And labor souls to win, working with Thee.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines>Savior, we weary not, working with Thee,<br/>As hard as Thine our lot can never be;<br/>Our joy and comfort this, “Thy grace sufficent is;”<br/>This changes toil to bliss, working with Thee.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v4">
      <lines>So let us labor on, working with Thee,<br/>Till earth to Thee is won, from sin set free;<br/>Till men, from shore to shore, receive Thee, and adore,<br/>And join us evermore, working with Thee.</lines>
    </verse>
