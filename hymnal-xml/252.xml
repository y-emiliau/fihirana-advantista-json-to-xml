    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>Come, let us sing the song of songs<br/>The angels first began the strain<br/>The homage which to Christ belongs:<br/>“Worthy the Lamb, for He was slain!”</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>Slain to redeem us by His blood,<br/>To cleanse from every sinful stain,<br/>And make us kings and priests to God:<br/>“Worthy the Lamb, for He was slain!”</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines>To Him who suffered on the tree,<br/>Our souls, at His soul’s price, to gain,<br/>Blessing, and praise, and glory be:<br/>“Worthy the Lamb, for He was slain!”</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v4">
      <lines>To Him, enthroned by filial right<br/>All power in heaven and earth proclaim,<br/>Honor, and majesty, and might:<br/>“Worthy the Lamb, for He was slain!”</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v5">
      <lines>Long as we live, and when we die,<br/>And while in heaven with Him we reign,<br/>This song our song of songs shall be:<br/>“Worthy the Lamb, for He was slain!”</lines>
