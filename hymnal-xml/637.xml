    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>Son of God, eternal Savior,<br/>Source of life and truth and grace,<br/>Work made flesh, whose birth among us<br/>Hallows all our human race,<br/>You our head, who throned in glory,<br/>For Your own will ever plead:<br/>Fill us with Your love and pity,<br/>Heal our wrongs, and help our need.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>Bind us all as one together<br/>In Your church’s sacred fold,<br/>Weak and healthy, poor and wealthy,<br/>Sad and joyful, young and old.<br/>Is there want or pain or sorrow?<br/>Make us all the burden share.<br/>Are there spirits crushed and broken?<br/>Teach us, Lord, to soothe their care.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines>As You, Lord, have lived for others,<br/>So may we for others live.<br/>Freely have Your gifts been granted;<br/>Freely may Your servants give.<br/>Yours the gold and Yours the silver,<br/>Yours the wealth of land and sea;<br/>We but stewards of Your bounty<br/>Held in solemn trust will be.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v4">
      <lines>Come, O Christ, and reign among us,<br/>King of love and Prince of Peace;<br/>Hush the storm of strife and passion,<br/>Bid its cruel discords cease.<br/>By Your patient years of toiling,<br/>By Your silent hours of pain,<br/>Quench our fevered thirst of pleasure,<br/>Stem our selfish greed of gain.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v5">
      <lines>Son of God, eternal Savior,<br/>Source of life and truth and grace,<br/>Word made flesh, whose birth among us<br/>Hallows all our human race:<br/>By Your praying, by Your willing<br/>That Your people should be one,<br/>Grant, oh, grant our hope’s fruition:<br/>Here on earth Your will be done.</lines>
