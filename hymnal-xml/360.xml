    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>From the eastern mountains Pressing on they come,<br/>Wise men in their wisdom, To His humble home;<br/>Stirred by deep devotion, Hasting from afar,<br/>Ever journeying onward, Guided by a star.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>There their Lord and Savior Meek and lowly,<br/>Wondrous light that led them Onward on their way,<br/>Ever now to lighten Nations from afar,<br/>As they journey homeward By that guiding star.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines>Gather in the outcasts All who’ve gone astray,<br/>Throw Thy radiance o’er them, Guide them on their way;<br/>Those who never knew Thee, Those who’ve wandered far,<br/>Guide them by the brightness Of Thy guiding star.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v4">
      <lines>Until every nation, Whether bond or free,<br/>‘Neath Thy starlit banner, Jesus follows thee.<br/>O’er the distant mountains To that heavenly home,<br/>Where no sin nor sorrow Evermore shall come.</lines>
    </verse>
