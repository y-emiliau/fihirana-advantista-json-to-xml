    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>Thy hand, O God, has guided<br/>Thy flock from age to age;<br/>The wondrous tale is written<br/>Full clear on every page;<br/>Our fathers owned Thy goodness,<br/>And we their deeds record;<br/>And both of this bear witness,<br/>One church, one faith, one Lord.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>Thy heralds brought glad tidings<br/>To greatest as to least;<br/>They bade men rise and hasten<br/>To share the great King’s feast:<br/>And this was all their teaching,<br/>In every deed and word,<br/>To all alike proclaiming<br/>One church, one faith, one Lord.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines>When shadows thick were falling,<br/>And all seemed sunk in night,<br/>Thou, Lord, did send Thy servants,<br/>Thy chosen sons of light.<br/>On them and on Thy people<br/>Thy plenteous grace was poured,<br/>And this was still their message:<br/>One church, one faith, one Lord.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v4">
      <lines>Thy mercy will not fail us,<br/>Nor leave Thy work undone;<br/>With Thy right hand to help us,<br/>The vict’ry shall be won;<br/>And then by men and angels<br/>Thy name shall be adored,<br/>And this shall be their anthem:<br/>One church, one faith, one Lord.</lines>
