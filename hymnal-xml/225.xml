    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>God is working His purpose out<br/>As year succeeds to year;<br/>God is working His purpose out,<br/>And the time is drawing near;<br/>Nearer and nearer draws the time,<br/>The time that shall surely be<br/>When the earth shall be filled<br/>with the glory of God<br/>As the waters cover the sea.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>From utmost east to utmost west,<br/>Where’er man’s foot hath trod,<br/>By the mouth of many messengers<br/>Goes forth the voice of God;<br/>Give ear to me, ye continents,<br/>Ye isles, give ear to me,<br/>That the earth shall be filled<br/>with the glory of God<br/>As the waters cover the sea.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines>March we forth in the strength of God<br/>With the banner of Christ unfurled,<br/>That the light of the glorious gospel of truth<br/>May shine throughout the world:<br/>Fight we the fight with sorrow and sin<br/>To set their captives free,<br/>That the earth shall be filled<br/>with the glory of God<br/>As the waters cover the sea.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v4">
      <lines>All we can do is nothing worth<br/>Unless God blesses the deed;<br/>Vainly we hope for the harvest tide<br/>Till God gives life to the seed;<br/>Yet nearer and nearer draws the time,<br/>The time that shall surely be,<br/>When the earth shall be filled<br/>with the glory of God<br/>As the waters cover the sea.</lines>
