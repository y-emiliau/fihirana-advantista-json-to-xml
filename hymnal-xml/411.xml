    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>The Son of God proclaim,<br/>The Lord of time and space;<br/>The God who bade the light break forth<br/>Now shines in Jesus’ face.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>Behold His out stretched hands,<br/>Though all was in His power<br/>He took the towel and basin then,<br/>And serves us in this hour.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines>He, God’s creative word,<br/>The church’s Lord and head,<br/>Here bids us gather as His friends,<br/>And share His wine and bread.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v4">
      <lines>The Lord of life and death<br/>With wondering praise we sing;<br/>We break the bread at His command,<br/>And name Him God and King.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v5">
      <lines>We take this cup in hope:<br/>For He, who gladly bore<br/>The shameful cross, is ris’n again,<br/>And reigns forevermore.</lines>
    </verse>
