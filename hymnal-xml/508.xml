    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>Anywhere with Jesus I can safely go,<br/>Anywhere He leads me in this world below;<br/>Anywhere without Him dearest joys would fade;<br/>Anywhere with Jesus I am not afraid.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="c1">
      <lines>Anywhere, anywhere! Fear I cannot know;<br/>Anywhere with Jesus I can safely go.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>Anywhere with Jesus I am not alone;<br/>Other friends may fail me, He is still my own;<br/>Though His hand may lead me over drearest ways,<br/>Anywhere with Jesus is a house of praise.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines>Anywhere with Jesus I can go to sleep,<br/>When the darkening shadows round about me creep,<br/>Knowing I shall waken nevermore to roam;<br/>Anywhere with Jesus will be home, sweet home.</lines>
    </verse>
