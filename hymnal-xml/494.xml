    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>“We would see Jesus;” for the shadows lengthen<br/>Across the little landscape of our life;<br/>We would see Jesus, our weak faith to strengthen<br/>For the last conflict, in this mortal strife.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>“We would see Jesus,” Rock of our salvation,<br/>Where on our feet were set with sovereign grace;<br/>Not life, nor death, with all their agitation,<br/>Can thence remove us, gazing on His face.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines>“We would see Jesus;” other lights are paling,<br/>Which for long years we did rejoice to see;<br/>The blessings of this sinful world are failing;<br/>We would not mourn them, in exchange for Thee.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v4">
      <lines>“We would see Jesus;” this is all we’re needing-<br/>Strength, joy and willingness come with the sight;<br/>We would see Jesus, dying, risen, pleading,<br/>Soon to return and end this mortal night!</lines>
    </verse>
