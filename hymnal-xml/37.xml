    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>O sing my soul, your Maker’s praise<br/>In grateful hymns ascending;<br/>Whose steadfast love has crowned your days<br/>With heav’nly gifts un ending.<br/>I sought the Lord, He heard my cry;<br/>His holy angels hover nigh<br/>The tents of those who love Him.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>The Lord is good to those who seek<br/>His face in time of sorrow,<br/>Providing comfort to the weak<br/>And grace for each tomorrow.<br/>Though grief may tarry for a night,<br/>The morn shall break in joy and light<br/>With blessings from His presence.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines>The Lord will turn His face in peace<br/>When troubled souls draw near Him;<br/>His loving kindness shall not cease<br/>To those who trust and fear Him.<br/>Our God will not forsake His own;<br/>Eternal is His heav’nly throne;<br/>His kingdom stands forever.</lines>
