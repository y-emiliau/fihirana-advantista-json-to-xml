    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>A wonderful Savior is Jesus my Lord,<br/>A wonderful Savior to me,<br/>He hideth my soul in the cleft of the rock,<br/>Where rivers of pleasure I see.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="c1">
      <lines>He hideth my soul in the cleft of the rock<br/>That shadows a dry, thirsty land;<br/>he hideth my life in the depths of His love,<br/>And covers me there with His hand,<br/>And covers me there with His hand.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>A wonderful Savior is Jesus my Lord,<br/>He taketh my burden away,<br/>He holdeth me up, and I shall not be moved,<br/>He giveth me strength as my day.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines>With numberless blessings each moment He crowns,<br/>And filled with His fullness divine,<br/>I sing in my rapture, Oh, Glory to God<br/>For such a Redeemer as mine.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v4">
      <lines>When clothed in His brightness, transported I rise<br/>To meet Him in clouds of the sky,<br/>His perfect salvation, His wonderful love,<br/>Iâ€™ll shout with the millions on high.</lines>
    </verse>
