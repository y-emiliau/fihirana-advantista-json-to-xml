    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>We have not known Thee as we ought,<br/>Nor learned Thy wisdom, grace, and power;<br/>The things of earth have filed our thoughts,<br/>And trifles of the passing hour.<br/>Lord, give us light Thy truth to see,<br/>And make us wise in knowing Thee.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>We have not feared Thee as we ought,<br/>Nor bowed beneath Thine awful eye,<br/>Nor guarded deed, and word, and thought,<br/>Remembering that God was nigh.<br/>Lord, give us faith to know Thee near,<br/>And grant the grace of holy fear.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines>We have not loved Thee as we ought,<br/>Nor cared that we are loved by Thee;<br/>Thy presence we have coldly sought,<br/>And feebly longed Thy face to see.<br/>Lord, give a pure and loving heart<br/>To feel and own the love Thou art.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v4">
      <lines>We have not served Thee as we ought;<br/>Alas! the duties left undone,<br/>The work with little fervor wrought,<br/>The battles lost, or scarcely won!<br/>Lord, give the zeal, and give the might,<br/>For Thee to toil, for Thee to fight.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v5">
      <lines>When shall we know Thee as we ought,<br/>And fear, and love, and serve aright!<br/>When shall we, out of trial brought,<br/>Be perfect in the land of light!<br/>Lord, may we day by day prepare<br/>To see Thy face, and serve Thee there.</lines>
