    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>I come with joy to meet my Lord,<br/>Forgiven, loved and free,<br/>In awe and wonder to recall<br/>His life laid down for me,<br/>His life laid down for me.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>I come with Christians far and near<br/>To find, as all are fed,<br/>Our true community of love<br/>In Christ’s communion bread,<br/>In Christ’s communion bread.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines>As Christ breaks bread for us to share<br/>Each proud division ends.<br/>That love that made us makes us one,<br/>And strangers now are friends,<br/>And strangers now are friends.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v4">
      <lines>And thus with joy we meet our Lord.<br/>His presence always near,<br/>Is in such friendship better known:<br/>We see and praise Him here,<br/>We see and praise Him here.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v5">
      <lines>Together met, together bound,<br/>We’ll go our diff’rent ways,<br/>And as His people in the world,<br/>We’ll live and speak His praise,<br/>We’ll live and speak His praise.</lines>
    </verse>
