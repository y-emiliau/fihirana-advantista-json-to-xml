    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>Spring has now unwrapped the flowers,<br/>Day is fast reviving,<br/>Life in all her growing powers<br/>Towards the light is striving:<br/>Gone the iron touch of cold,<br/>Winter time and frost time,<br/>Seedlings, working through the mould,<br/>Now make up for lost time.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>Herb and plant that winter long,<br/>Slumbered at their leisurek,<br/>Now be stirring, green and strong,<br/>Find in growth their pleasure:<br/>All the world with beauty fills,<br/>Gold the green enhacing;<br/>Flowers make glee among the hills,<br/>Set the meadows dancing.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines>Through each wonder of fair days<br/>God Himself expresses;<br/>Beauty follows all His ways,<br/>As the world He blesses:<br/>So, as He renews the earth,<br/>Artist without rival,<br/>In His grace of glad new birth<br/>We must seek revival.</lines>
