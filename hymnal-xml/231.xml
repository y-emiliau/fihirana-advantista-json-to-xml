    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>Blest be the King whose coming<br/>Is in the name of God!<br/>For Him let doors be opened,<br/>No hearts against Him barred!<br/>Not robed in royal splendor,<br/>In power and pomp comes He;<br/>But clad as are the poorest,<br/>Such His humility.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>Blest be the King whose coming<br/>Is in the name of God!<br/>By those who truly listen<br/>His voice is truly heard;<br/>Pity the proud and haughty,<br/>Who have not learned to heed<br/>The Christ who is the promise,<br/>Who has atonement made.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines>Blest be the King whose coming<br/>Is in the name of God!<br/>He only to the humble<br/>Reveals the face of God.<br/>All power is His, all glory!<br/>All things are in His hand,<br/>All ages and all peoples,<br/>â€˜Till time itself shall end.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v4">
      <lines>Blest be the King whose coming<br/>Is in the name of God!<br/>He offers to the burdened<br/>The rest and grace they need.<br/>Gentle is He and humble!<br/>And light his Yoke shall be,<br/>For He would have us bear it,<br/>So He can made us free!</lines>
    </verse>
