    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>Look, you saints, the sight is glorious,<br/>See the Man of sorrows now;<br/>From the fight returned victorious,<br/>Every knee to Him shall bow.<br/>Crown Him! Crown Him! Crown Him!<br/>Crown Him! Crown Him! Crown Him!<br/>Crowns become the victor’s brow.<br/>Crowns become the victor’s brow.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>Crown the Savior! angels crown Him!<br/>Rich the trophies Jesus brings;<br/>On the seat of power enthrone Him<br/>While the vault of heaven rings.<br/>Crown Him! Crown Him! Crown Him!<br/>Crown Him! Crown Him! Crown Him!<br/>Crown the Savior, King of Kings.<br/>Crown the Savior, King of Kings.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines>Sinners in derision crowned Him,<br/>Mocking thus the Savior’s claim;<br/>Saints and angels crowd around Him,<br/>Own His title, praise His name.<br/>Crown Him! Crown Him! Crown Him!<br/>Crown Him! Crown Him! Crown Him!<br/>Spread abroad the victor’s fame!<br/>Spread abroad the victor’s fame!</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v4">
      <lines>Hark! those bursts of acclamation!<br/>Hark! those loud triumphant chords!<br/>Jesus takes the highest station;<br/>Oh, what joy the sight affords!<br/>Crown Him! Crown Him! Crown Him!<br/>Crown Him! Crown Him! Crown Him!<br/>King of kings and Lord of lords!<br/>King of kings and Lord of lords!</lines>
