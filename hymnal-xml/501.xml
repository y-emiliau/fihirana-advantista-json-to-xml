    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>‘Tis the blessed hour of prayer, when our hearts lowly bend,<br/>And we gather to Jesus, our Savior and Friend;<br/>If we come to Him in faith, His protection to share,</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="c1">
      <lines>What a balm for the weary! O how sweet to be there!<br/>Blessed hour of prayer, Blessed hour of prayer,<br/>What a balm for the weary! O how sweet to be there!</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>‘Tis the blessed hour of prayer, when the Savior draws near,<br/>With a tender compassion His children to hear;<br/>When He tells us we may cast at His feet every care,</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines>‘Tis the blessed hour of prayer, when the tempted and tried<br/>To the Savior who loves them their sorrows confide;<br/>With a sympathizing heart He removes every care;</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v4">
      <lines>‘Tis the blessed hour of prayer, trusting Him we believe,<br/>That the blessings we’re needing we’ll surely receive;<br/>In the fullness of this trust we shall lose every care;</lines>
    </verse>
