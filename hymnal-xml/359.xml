    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>Hark! the voice of Jesus calling,<br/>“Who will go and work today?<br/>Fields are white, the harvest waiting,<br/>Who will bear the sheaves away?”<br/>Loud and long the Master calleth,<br/>Rich reward He offers free;<br/>Who will answer, gladly saying,<br/>“Here am I, O Lord, send me”?</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>If you cannot cross the ocean<br/>And the heathen lands explore,<br/>You can find the heathen nearer,<br/>You can help them at your door;<br/>If you cannot speak like angels,<br/>If you cannot preach like Paul,<br/>You can tell the love of Jesus,<br/>You can say He died for all.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines>If you cannot be the watchman,<br/>Standing high on Zion’s wall,<br/>Pointing out the path to heaven,<br/>Offering life and peace to all;<br/>With your prayers and with your bounties<br/>You can do what Heaven demands,<br/>You can be like faithful Aaron,<br/>Holding up the prophet’s hands.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v4">
      <lines>While the souls of men are dying,<br/>And the Master calls for you,<br/>Let none hear you idly saying,<br/>“There is nothing I can do!”<br/>Gladly take the task He gives you,<br/>Let His work your pleasure be;<br/>Answer quickly when He calleth,<br/>“Here am I, O Lord, send me.”</lines>
