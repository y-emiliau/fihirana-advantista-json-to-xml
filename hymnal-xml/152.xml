    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>Tell me the story of Jesus,<br/>Write on my heart every word.<br/>Tell me the story most precious,<br/>Sweetest that ever was heard.<br/>Tell how the angels in chorus,<br/>Sang as they welcomed His birth.<br/>“Glory to God in the highest!<br/>Peace and good tidings to earth.”</lines>

    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>Fasting alone in the desert,<br/>Tell of the days that are past.<br/>How for our sins He was tempted,<br/>Yet was triumphant at last.<br/>Tell of the years of His labor,<br/>Tell of the sorrow He bore.<br/>He was despised and afflicted,<br/>Homeless, rejected and poor.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines>Tell of the cross where they nailed Him,<br/>Writhing in anguish and pain.<br/>Tell of the grave where they laid Him,<br/>Tell how He liveth again.<br/>Love in that story so tender,<br/>Clearer than ever I see.<br/>Stay, let me weep while you whisper,<br/>Love paid the ransom for me.</lines>
