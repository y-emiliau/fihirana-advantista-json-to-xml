    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>God sent His Son, they called Him Jesus,<br/>He came to love, heal, and forgive;<br/>He lived and died to buy my pardon,<br/>An empty grave is there to prove my Savior lives.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="c1">
      <lines>Because He lives I can face tomorrow,<br/>Because He lives all fear is gone;<br/>Because I know He holds the future.<br/>And life is worth the living just because He lives.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>How sweet to hold a newborn baby,<br/>And feel the pride, and joy He gives;<br/>But greater still the calm assurance,<br/>This child can face uncertain days because He lives.</lines>
    </verse>
