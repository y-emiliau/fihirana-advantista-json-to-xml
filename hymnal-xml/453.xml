    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>We have heard from the bright, the holy, land;<br/>We have heard, and our hearts are glad;<br/>For we were a lonely pilgrim band,<br/>And weary, and worn, and sad.<br/>They tell us the saints have a dwelling there-<br/>No longer are homeless ones;<br/>And we know that the goodly land is fair,<br/>Where life’s pure river runs.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>They say green fields are waving there,<br/>That never a blight shall know;<br/>And the deserts wild are blooming fair,<br/>And the roses of Sharon grow.<br/>There are lovely birds in the bowers green,<br/>Their songs are blithe and sweet;<br/>And their warblings, gushing ever new,<br/>The angels’ harpings greet.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines>We have heard of the palms, the robes, the crowns,<br/>And the silvery band in white;<br/>Of the city fair, with pearly gates,<br/>All radiant with light.<br/>We have heard of the angels there, and saints,<br/>With their harps of gold, how they sing;<br/>Of the mount with the fruitful tree of life,<br/>Of the leaves that healing bring.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v4">
      <lines>The King of that country, He is fair,<br/>He’s the joy and light of the place;<br/>In His beauty we shall behold Him there,<br/>And bask in His smiling face,<br/>We’ll be there, we’ll be there in a little while,<br/>We’ll join the pure and the blest;<br/>We’ll have the palm, the robe, the crown,<br/>And forever be at rest.</lines>
