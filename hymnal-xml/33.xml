    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>Sing a new song to the Lord,<br/>He to whom wonders belong.<br/>Rejoice in His triumph and tell of His power.<br/>O sing a new song to the Lord.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>Now to the ends of the earth<br/>See His salvation is shown.<br/>And still He remembers His mercy and truth,<br/>Unchanging in love to His own.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines>Sing a new song and rejoice.<br/>Publish His praises abroad.<br/>Let voices in chorus with trumpet and horn,<br/>Resound for the joy of the Lord.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v4">
      <lines>Join with the hills and the sea,<br/>Thunders of praise to prolong.<br/>In judgement and justice<br/>He comes to the earth<br/>O sing a new song to the Lord.</lines>
