    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>All my hope on God is founded;<br/>He doth still my trust renew.<br/>Me through change and chance He guideth,<br/>Only good and only true.<br/>God unknown, He alone<br/>Calls my heart to be His own.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>Pride of man and earthly glory,<br/>Sword and crown betray his trust;<br/>What with care and toil he buildeth,<br/>Tower and temple fall to dust.<br/>But God’s power, hour by hour,<br/>Is my temple and my tower.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines>God’s great goodness aye endureth,<br/>Deep His wisdom, passing thought;<br/>Splendor, light and life attend Him,<br/>Beauty springeth out of naught.<br/>Love doth stand at His hand;<br/>Joy doth wait on His command.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v4">
      <lines>Still from man to God eternal,<br/>Sacrifice of praise be done.<br/>High above all praises praising,<br/>For the gift of Christ His son.<br/>Christ doth call one and all:<br/>Ye who follow shall not fall.</lines>
    </verse>
