    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>New songs of celebration render<br/>To Him who has great wonders done.<br/>Love sits enthroned in ageless splendor:<br/>Come, and adore the mighty One.<br/>He has made known His great salvation<br/>Which all His friends with joy confess:<br/>He has revealed to every nation<br/>His everlasting righteousness.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>Joyfully, heartily resounding,<br/>Let every instrument and voice<br/>Peal out the praise of grace abounding<br/>Calling the whole world to rejoice.<br/>Trumpets and organs, set in motion<br/>Such sounds as make the heavens ring;<br/>All things that live in earth and ocean,<br/>Make music for your mighty King.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines>Rivers and seas and torrents roaring,<br/>Honor the Lord with wild acclaim;<br/>Mountains and stones look up adoring,<br/>And find a voice to praise His name.<br/>Righteous, commanding, ever glorious,<br/>Praises be His that never cease:<br/>Just is our God, whose truth victorious,<br/>Establishes the world in peace.</lines>
