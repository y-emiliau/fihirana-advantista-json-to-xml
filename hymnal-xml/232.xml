    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>At the name of Jesus<br/>every knee shall bow,<br/>Every tongue confess<br/>Him King of glory now;<br/>“Tis the Father’s pleasure<br/>we should call Him Lord,<br/>Who from the beginning<br/>was the mighty Word.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>At His voice creation<br/>sprang at once to sight,<br/>All the angel faces,<br/>All the hosts of light,<br/>Thrones and dominations<br/>stars upon their way,<br/>All the heavenly orders<br/>in their great array.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines>Humbled for a season,<br/>To receive a name<br/>From the lips of sinners,<br/>Unto whom He came;<br/>He is God the Savior,<br/>He is Christ the Lord,<br/>Ever to be worshiped,<br/>Trusted and adored.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v4">
      <lines>In your hearts enthrone Him:<br/>There let Him subdue<br/>All that is not holy,<br/>All that is not true;<br/>Crown Him as your captain<br/>in temptation’s hour,<br/>Let His will enfold you<br/>in its light and power.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v5">
      <lines>Surely, this Lord Jesus<br/>shall return again,<br/>With His Father’s glory,<br/>With His angel train;<br/>For all wreaths of empire<br/>meet upon His brow,<br/>And our hearts confess<br/>Him King of glory now.</lines>
