    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>I saw one weary, sad, and torn,<br/>With eager steps press on the way,<br/>Who long the hallowed cross had born,<br/>Still looking for the promised day;<br/>While many a line of grief and care,<br/>Upon his brow was furrowed there;<br/>I asked what buoyed his spirits up,<br/>“O this” said he-“the blessed hope.”</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>And one I saw, with sword and shield,<br/>Who boldly braved the world’s cold frown,<br/>And fought, unyielding, on the field,<br/>To win an everlasting crown.<br/>Though worn with toil, oppressed by foes,<br/>No murmur from his heart arose;<br/>I asked what buoyed his spirits up,<br/>“O this!” said he-“the blessed hope.”</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines>And there was one who left behind<br/>The cherished friends of early years,<br/>And honor, pleasure, wealth re-signed,<br/>To tread the path bedewed with tears.<br/>Through trials deep and conflict sore,<br/>Yet still a smile of joy he wore;<br/>O! what can bouy the spirit up?<br/>‘Tis this alone-the blessed hope.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v4">
      <lines>While pilgrims here we journey on<br/>In this dark vale of sin and gloom,<br/>Through tribulation, hate, and scorn,<br/>Or through the portals of the tomb,<br/>Till our returning King shall come<br/>To tkae His exile captives home,<br/>O! what can bouy the spirits up?<br/>‘Tis this alone- the blessed hope.</lines>
