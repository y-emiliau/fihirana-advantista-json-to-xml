    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>Nothing between my soul and my Savior,<br/>naught of this world’s delusive dream;<br/>I have renounced all sinful pleasure;<br/>Jesus is mine, there’s nothing between.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="c1">
      <lines>Nothing between my soul and my Savior,<br/>so that his blessed face may be seen;<br/>nothing preventing the least of his favor;<br/>keep the way clear! let nothing between.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>Nothing between, like worldly pleasure;<br/>habits of life, though harmless they seem,<br/>must not my heart from him ever sever;<br/>he is my all, there’s nothing between.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines>Nothing between, e’en many hard trials,<br/>though the whole world against me convene;<br/>watching with prayer and much self denial,<br/>I’ll triumph at last, there’s nothing between.</lines>
    </verse>
