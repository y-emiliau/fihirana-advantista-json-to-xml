    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>Once in royal Davidâ€™s city<br/>Stood a lowly cattle shed,<br/>Where a mother laid her Baby<br/>In a manger for His bed;<br/>Mary was that mother mild,<br/>Jesus Christ her little Child.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>He came down to earth from heaven,<br/>Who is God and Lord of all,<br/>And His shelter was a stable,<br/>And His cradle was a stall;<br/>With the poor, and mean, and lowly,<br/>Lived on earth our Savior holy.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines>And through all His wondrous childhood<br/>He would honor and obey,<br/>Love and watch the lowly mother<br/>In whose gentle arms He lay.<br/>Christian children all must be<br/>Mild, obedient, good as He.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v4">
      <lines>And our eyes at last shall see Him,<br/>Through His own redeeming love;<br/>For that Child so dear and gentle<br/>Is our Lord in heaven above;<br/>And He leads His children on<br/>To the place where He is gone.</lines>
    </verse>
