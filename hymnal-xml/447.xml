    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>Long upon the mountains weary,<br/>Have the scattered flocks been torn;<br/>Dark the dessert paths, and dreary;<br/>Grievous trials have they borne.<br/>Now the gathering call is sounding,<br/>Solemn in its warning voice;<br/>Union, faith, and love, abounding,<br/>Bid the little flock rejoice.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>Now the light of truth they’re seeking,<br/>In its onward track pursue;<br/>All the ten commandments keeping,<br/>They are holy, just, and true.<br/>On the words of lire they’re feeding,<br/>Precious to their taste so sweet;<br/>All their Master’s percepts heeding,<br/>Bowing humbly to His feet.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines>In that light of light and beauty,<br/>In that golden city fair,<br/>Soon its pearly gates they’ll enter,<br/>And of all its glories share.<br/>There, divine the soul’s expansions;<br/>Free from sin, and death, and pain;<br/>Tear will never dim those mansions<br/>Where the souls immortal reign.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v4">
      <lines>Soon He comes! With clouds descending;<br/>All His saints, entombed arise;<br/>The redeemed, in anthems blending,<br/>Shout their vict’ry thro’ the skies.<br/>O, we long for Thine appearing;<br/>Come, O Savior, quickly come!<br/>Blessed hope! Our spirits cheering,<br/>Take thy ransomed children home.</lines>
