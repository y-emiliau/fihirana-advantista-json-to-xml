    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>Let your heart be broken for a world in need:<br/>Feed the mouths that hunger, soothe the wounds that bleed,<br/>Give the cup of water and the loaf of bread<br/>Be the hands of Jesus, serving in His stead.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>Here on earth applying principles of love,<br/>Visible expression - God still rules above<br/>Living illustration of the Living Word<br/>To the minds of all who’ve Never seen or heard.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines>Blest to be a blessing privileged to care,<br/>Challenged by the need apparent everywhere.<br/>Where mankind is wanting, fill the vacant place.<br/>Be the means through which the Lord reveals His grace.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v4">
      <lines>Add to your believing deeds that prove it true,<br/>Knowing Christ as Savior, make Him Master, too.<br/>Follow in His footsteps, go where He has trod;<br/>In the world’s great trouble risk yourself for God.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v5">
      <lines>Let your heart be tender and your vision clear;<br/>See mankind as God sees, serve Him far and near.<br/>Let your heart be broken by a brother’s pain;<br/>Share your rich resources, give and give again.</lines>
    </verse>
