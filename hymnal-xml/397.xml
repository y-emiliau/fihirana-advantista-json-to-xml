    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>An upper room did our Lord prepare<br/>For those loved until the end:<br/>And His disciples still gather there,<br/>To celebrate their risen Friend.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>And after supper He washed their feet,<br/>For service, too, is sacrament.<br/>In Him our joy shall be made complete<br/>Sent out to serve, as He was sent.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines>A lasting gift Jesus gave His own:<br/>To share His bread, His loving cup.<br/>Whatever burdens may bow us down,<br/>He by His cross shall lift us up.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v4">
      <lines>No end there is! we depart in peace.<br/>He loves beyond our uttermost:<br/>In every room in our Fatherâ€™s house,<br/>He will be there, as Lord and host.</lines>
    </verse>
