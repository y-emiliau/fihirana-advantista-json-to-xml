      <lines>When believers break the bread,<br/>when a hungry child is fed:<br/>Praise the love that Christ revealed,<br/>living, working in our world.</lines>

      <lines>Still His Spirit leads the fight,<br/>seeing wrong and setting right:<br/>God in Christ has come to stay,<br/>we can see His pow’r today.</lines>

      <lines>May His Spirit fill our praise,<br/>guide our thoughts and change our ways.<br/>God in Christ has come to stay,<br/>we can see His power today.</lines>
