    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>How far from? I asked, as on<br/>I bent my steps-the watchman spake:<br/>“the long, dark night is almost gone,<br/>The morning soon will break.<br/>Then weep no more, but speed thy flight,<br/>With Hope’s bright star guiding ray,<br/>Till thou shalt reach the realms of light,<br/>In everlasting days.”</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>I asked the warrior on the field;<br/>This was his soul-inspiring song:<br/>“With courage, bold, the sword I’ll wield,<br/>The battle is not long.<br/>Then weep no more, but well endure<br/>The conflict, till thy work is done;<br/>For this we know, the prize is sure,<br/>When victory is won.”</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines>I asked again; earth, sea, and sun<br/>Seemed, with one voice, to make reply:<br/>“Time’s wasting sands are nearly run,<br/>Eternity is nigh.<br/>Then weep no more-with warning tones,<br/>Portentous signs are thickening round,<br/>The whole creation, waiting, groans,<br/>To hear the trumpet sound.”</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v4">
      <lines>Not far from home! O blessed thought!<br/>The traveler’s lonely heart to cheer;<br/>Which oft a healing balm has brought,<br/>And dried the mourner’s tear.<br/>Then weep no more, since we shall meet<br/>Where weary footsteps never roam-<br/>Our trails past, our joys complete,<br/>Safe in our Father’s home.</lines>
