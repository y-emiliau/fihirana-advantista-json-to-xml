    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>Crown him with many crowns,<br/>the Lamb upon his throne,<br/>Hark! how the heavenly anthem drowns<br/>all music but its own.<br/>Awake, my soul, and sing<br/>of him who died for thee,<br/>and hail him as thy matchless King<br/>through all eternity.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>Crown him the Lord of love!<br/>behold his hands and side,<br/>those wounds, yet visible above,<br/>in beauty glorified;<br/>No angel in the sky<br/>Can fully bear that sight,<br/>But downward bend his wondering eye<br/>At mysteries so great.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines>Crown him the Lord of peace!<br/>whose power a scepter sways<br/>from pole to pole, that wars may cease,<br/>and all be prayer and praise.<br/>His reign shall know no end,<br/>and round his pierced feet<br/>fair flowers of paradise extend<br/>their fragrance ever sweet.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v4">
      <lines>Crown him the Lord of years;<br/>The potentate of time,<br/>Creator of the rolling spheres,<br/>Ineffably sublime!<br/>All hail, Redeemer, hail!<br/>For thou hast died for me;<br/>thy praise shall never, never fail<br/>throughout eternity.</lines>
    </verse>
