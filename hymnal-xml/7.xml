    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>The Lord in Zion reigneth,<br/>let all the world rejoice,<br/>And come before His throne of grace<br/>with tuneful heart and voice;<br/>The Lord in Zion reigneth,<br/>and there His praise shall ring,<br/>To Him shall princes bend the knee<br/>and kings their glory bring.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>The Lord in Zion reigneth,<br/>and who so great as He?<br/>The depths of earth are in His hands;<br/>He rules the mighty sea.<br/>O crown His Name with honor,<br/>and let His standard wave,<br/>Till distant isles beyond the deep<br/>shall own His power to save.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines>The Lord in Zion reigneth,<br/>these hours to Him belong;<br/>O enter now His temple gates,<br/>and fill His courts with song;<br/>Beneath His royal banner<br/>let every creature fall,<br/>Exalt the King of heaven and earth,<br/>and crown Him Lord of all.</lines>
