    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>O solemn thought and can it be<br/>The hour o judgment now is come<br/>Which soon must fix our destiny,<br/>And seal the sinner’s fearful down?<br/>Yes, it is so; the judgment hour<br/>Is swiftly hastening to its close;<br/>Then will the Judge, in mighty power,<br/>Descend in vengeance on His foes.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>He who came down to earth to die<br/>An offering for the sins of men,<br/>And then ascended upon on high,<br/>And will e’er long return again,<br/>Is standing now before the ark,<br/>And mercy seat and cherubim,<br/>To plead His blood for saints, and make<br/>The last remembrance of their sin.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines>The solemn moment is at hand<br/>When we who have His name confessed,<br/>Each in his lot must singly stand<br/>And pass the final, searching test.<br/>Jesus! we hope in Thee alone;<br/>In mercy now upon us look,<br/>Confess our names before the throne,<br/>And blot our sins from out Thy book.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v4">
      <lines>O blessed Savior! may we feel<br/>The full importance of this hour.<br/>Inspire our hearts with holy zeal,<br/>And aid us by Thy Spirit’s power,<br/>That we may in Thy strength be strong,<br/>And brave the conflict valiantly;<br/>Then, on Mount Zion, join the song,<br/>And swell the notes of victory.</lines>
