    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>The Lord is my light; then why should I fear?<br/>By day and by night His presence is near;<br/>He is my salvation from sorrow and sin;<br/>This blessed persuasion the Spirit brings in.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="c1">
      <lines>The Lord is my light, my joy, and my song;<br/>By day and by night He leads me along;<br/>The Lord is my light, my joy, and my song;<br/>By day and by night He leads me along.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>The Lord is my light; though clods may arise,<br/>Faith, stronger than sight, looks up to the skies<br/>Where Jesus forever in glory doth reign:<br/>Then how can I ever in darkness remain?</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines>The Lord is my light, the Lord is my strength;<br/>I know in His might Iâ€™ll conquer at length;<br/>My weakness in mercy He covers with power,<br/>And, walking by faith, He upholds me each hour.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v4">
      <lines>The lord is my light, my all and in all;<br/>There is in His sight no darkness at all;<br/>He is my Redeemer, my Savior and King;<br/>With saints and with angels His praises I sing.</lines>
    </verse>
