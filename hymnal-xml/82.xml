    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>Before Jehovah’s awful throne,<br/>Ye nations, bow with sacred joy;<br/>Know that the Lord is God alone;<br/>He can create, and He destroy.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>His sovereign power, without our aid,<br/>Made us of clay, and formed us men;<br/>and when like wandering sheep we strayed,<br/>He brought us to His fold again.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines>We’ll crowd His gates with thankful songs,<br/>High as the heavens our voices raise;<br/>And earth, with her ten thousand tongues,<br/>Shall fill His courts with sounding praise.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v4">
      <lines>Wide as the world is His command,<br/>Vast as Eternity His love;<br/>Firm as a rock His truth shall stand,<br/>When rolling years shall cease to move.</lines>
    </verse>
