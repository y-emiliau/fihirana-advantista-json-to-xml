    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>That glorious day is coming,<br/>The hour is hastening on;<br/>Its radiant light is nearing,<br/>Far brighter than the sun;<br/>In yonder clouds of heaven,<br/>The Saviour will appear,<br/>And gather all His chosen,<br/>To meet Him in the air.<br/>The saints, then all victorious<br/>Will go to meet their Lord;<br/>An earth both bright and glorious,<br/>Will then be their reward;<br/>And God Himself there reigning,<br/>Will wipe all tears away;<br/>Nor clouds nor night remaining,<br/>But one eternal day.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>O Christian, keep from sleeping,<br/>And let your love abound;<br/>Be watchful, prayerful, faithful,<br/>The trumpet soon will sound!<br/>O sinner, hear the warning!<br/>To Jesus quickly fly!<br/>Then you, in that blest morning,<br/>May meet Him in the sky!</lines>
