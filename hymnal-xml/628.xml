    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>As Jacob with travel was weary one day,<br/>At night on a stone for a pillow he lay;<br/>He saw in a vision a ladder so high<br/>That its foot was on earth and its top in the sky.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="c1">
      <lines>Alleluia to Jesus who died on the tree,<br/>And has raised up a ladder of mercy for me,<br/>And has raised up a ladder of mercy for me.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>Come let us ascend! All may climb it who will;<br/>For the angels of Jacob are guarding it still:<br/>And remember each step that by faith we passo’er,<br/>Some prophet or martyr has trod it before.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines>And when we arrive at the haven of rest<br/>We shall hear the glad words, “Come up hither, ye blest,<br/>Here are regions of light, here are mansions of bliss.”<br/>O who would not climb such a ladder as this?</lines>
