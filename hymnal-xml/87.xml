    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>God who spoke in the beginning,<br/>Forming rock and shaping spar,<br/>Set all life and growth in motion,<br/>Earthly world and distant star;<br/>He who calls the earth to order<br/>Is the ground of what we are.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>God who spoke thro’ men and nations,<br/>Thro’ events long past and gone,<br/>Showing still today His purpose,<br/>Speaks supremely through His Son;<br/>He who calls the earth to order<br/>Gives His word and it is done.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines>God whose speech becomes incarnate -<br/>Christ is servant, Christ is Lord -<br/>Calls us to a life of service,<br/>Heart and will to action stirred;<br/>He who uses man’s obedience<br/>Has the first and final word.</lines>
