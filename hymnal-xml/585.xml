    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>When Christ was lifted from the earth<br/>His arms stretched out above<br/>Through every culture, every birth,<br/>to draw an answering love.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>Still east and west His love extends<br/>and always, near or far,<br/>He calls and claims us as His friends<br/>and loves us as we are.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines>Where generation, class, or race<br/>divides us to our shame,<br/>He sees not labels but a face,<br/>a person and a name.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v4">
      <lines>Thus freely loved, thoâ€™ fully known,<br/>may I in Christ be free<br/>To welcome and accept His own<br/>as Christ accepted me.</lines>
    </verse>
