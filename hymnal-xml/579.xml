      <lines>God is love; we're His little children.<br/>God is love; we would be like Him.<br/>'Tis love that makes us happy,<br/>'Tis love that smooths the way;<br/>It helps us "mind," it makes us kind<br/>To others every day.</lines>

    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>This world is full of sorrow,<br/>Of sickness, death, and sin;<br/>With loving heart we'll do our part,<br/>And try some soul to win.</lines>

    <verse name="v3">
      <lines>And when this life is over,<br/>And we are called above<br/>Our song shall be, eternally,<br/>Of Jesus and His love.</lines>
