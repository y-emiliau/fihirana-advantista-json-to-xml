    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>Soldiers of Christ,arise,<br/>And put your armor on,<br/>Strong in the strength which God supplies<br/>Through His eternal Son<br/>Strong in the Lord of hosts,<br/>And in His mighty power,<br/>Who in the strength of Jesus trusts<br/>Is more than conqueror.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>Stand then in His great might,<br/>With all His strength endued,<br/>But take, to arm you for the fight,<br/>The panoply of God;<br/>That, having all things done,<br/>And all your conflicts passed,<br/>Ye may o’ercome through Christ alone,<br/>And stand entire at last.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines>From strength to strength go on,<br/>Wrestle and fight and pray,<br/>Tread all the powers of darkness down<br/>And win the well-fought day.<br/>Still let the Spirit cry<br/>In all His soldiers, “Come!”<br/>Till Christ the Lord who reigns on high<br/>Shall take the conquerors home.</lines>
