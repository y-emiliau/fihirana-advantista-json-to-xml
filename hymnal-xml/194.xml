    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>Sing we of the modern city,<br/>Scene alike of joy and stress;<br/>Sing we of its nameless people<br/>In their urban wilderness.<br/>Into endless rows of houses<br/>Life is set a millionfold,<br/>Life expressed in human beings<br/>Daily born and growing old.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>In the city full of people,<br/>World of speed and hectic days,<br/>In the ever-changing setting<br/>Of the latest trend and craze,<br/>Christ is present, and among us;<br/>In the crowd we see Him stand.<br/>In the bustle of the city<br/>Jesus Christ is every man.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines>God is not remote in heaven,<br/>But on earth to share our shame,<br/>Changing graph and mass and number<br/>Into persons with a name.<br/>Christ has shown, beyond statistics,<br/>Human life with glory crowned,<br/>By His timeless presence proving<br/>People matter, people count!</lines>
