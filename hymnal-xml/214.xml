    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>We have this hope that burns within our heart,<br/>Hope in the coming of the Lord.<br/>We have this faith that Christ alone imparts,<br/>Faith in the promise of His Word.<br/>We believe the time is here,<br/>When the nations far and near<br/>Shall awake, and shout and sing<br/>Hallelujah! Christ is King!<br/>We have this hope that burns within our heart,<br/>Hope in the coming of the Lord.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>We are united in Jesus Christ our Lord.<br/>We are united in His love.<br/>Love for the waiting people of the world,<br/>People who need our Savior’s love.<br/>Soon the heav’ns will open wide,<br/>Christ will come to claim His bride,<br/>All the universe will sing<br/>Hallelujah! Christ is King!<br/>We have this hope this faith, and God’s great love,<br/>We are united in Christ.</lines>
