    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>I serve a risen Savior,<br/>He’s in the world today;<br/>I know that He is living,<br/>whatever men may say;<br/>I see His hand of mercy,<br/>I hear His voice of cheer<br/>And just the time<br/>I need Him He’s always near.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="c1">
      <lines>He lives, He lives,<br/>Christ Jesus lives today!<br/>He walks with me<br/>and talks with me<br/>along life’s narrow way.<br/>He lives, He lives,<br/>salvation to impart!<br/>You ask me how I know He lives?<br/>He lives within my heart.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>In all the world around me<br/>I see His loving care,<br/>And tho’ my heart grows weary<br/>I never will despair;<br/>I know that He is leading<br/>thru all the stormy blast,<br/>The day of His appearing<br/>will come at last.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines>Rejoice, rejoice, O Christian,<br/>lift up your voice and sing,<br/>Eternal hallelujahs<br/>to Jesus Christ the King!<br/>The hope of all who seek Him,<br/>the help of all who find,<br/>None other is so loving,<br/>so good and kind.</lines>
