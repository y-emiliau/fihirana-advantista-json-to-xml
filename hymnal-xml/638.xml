    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>wise may bring their learning,<br/>The rich may bring their wealth,<br/>And some may bring their greatness,<br/>And some their strength and health:<br/>We too would bring our treasures<br/>To offer to the King,<br/>We have no wealth or learning—<br/>What shall we children bring?</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>We’ll bring Him hearts that love Him,<br/>We’ll bring Him thankful praise,<br/>And young souls meekly striving<br/>To follow in His ways:<br/>And these be the treasures<br/>We offer to the King,<br/>And these are gifts that ever<br/>The poorest child may bring.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines>We’ll bring the little duties<br/>We have to do each day;<br/>We’ll try our best to please Him<br/>At home, at school, at play:<br/>And better are these treasures<br/>To offer to the King<br/>Than richest gift without them:<br/>Yet these a child may bring.</lines>
