    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>Blessed assurance, Jesus is mine!<br/>O what a foretaste of glory divine!<br/>Heir of salvation, purchase of God,<br/>born of his Spirit, washed in his blood.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="c1">
      <lines>This is my story, this is my song,<br/>praising my Savior all the day long;<br/>this is my story, this is my song,<br/>praising my Savior all the day long.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>Perfect submission, perfect delight,<br/>visions of rapture now burst on my sight;<br/>angels descending bring from above<br/>echoes of mercy, whispers of love.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines>Perfect submission, all is at rest;<br/>I in my Savior am happy and blest,<br/>watching and waiting, looking above,<br/>filled with his goodness, lost in his love.</lines>
    </verse>
