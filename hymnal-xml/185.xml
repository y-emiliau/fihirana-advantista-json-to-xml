      <lines>Jesus is all the world to me,<br/>my life, my joy, my all;<br/>he is my strength from day to day,<br/>without him I would fall.<br/>When I am sad, to him I go,<br/>no other one can cheer me so;<br/>when I am sad, he makes me glad,<br/>he’s my friend.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>Jesus is all the world to me,<br/>my friend in trials sore;<br/>I go to him for blessings, and<br/>he gives them o’er and o’er.<br/>He sends the sunshine and the rain,<br/>he sends the harvest’s golden grain;<br/>sunshine and rain, harvest of grain,<br/>he’s my friend.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines>Jesus is all the world to me,<br/>and true to him I’ll be;<br/>O how could I this friend deny,<br/>when he’s so true to me?<br/>Following him I know I’m right,<br/>he watches o’er me day and night;<br/>following him by day and night,<br/>he’s my friend.</lines>
    </verse>

      <lines>Jesus is all the world to me,<br/>I want no better friend;<br/>I trust him now, I’ll trust him when<br/>life’s fleeting days shall end.<br/>Beautiful life with such a friend,<br/>beautiful life that has no end;<br/>eternal life, eternal joy,<br/>he’s my friend.</lines>
