    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>Look upon Jesus, sinless is He;<br/>Father, impute His life unto me.<br/>My life of scarlet, my sin and woe,<br/>Cover with His life, whiter than snow.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="c1">
      <lines>Cover with His life, whiter than snow;<br/>Fullness of His life then shall I know;<br/>My life of scarlet, my sin and woe,<br/>Cover with His life, whither than snow.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>Deep are the wounds transgression has made;<br/>Red are the stains; my soul is afraid.<br/>O to be covered, Jesus, with Thee,<br/>Safe from the law that now judgeth me!</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines>Longing the joy of pardon to know;<br/>Jesus holds out a robe white as snow;<br/>“Lord, I accept it! Leaving my own,<br/>Gladly I wear Thy pure life alone.”</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v4">
      <lines>Reconciled by His death for my sin,<br/>Justified by His life pure and clean,<br/>Sanctified by obeying His word,<br/>Glorified when returneth my Lord.</lines>
    </verse>
