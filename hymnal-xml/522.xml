    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>My hope is built on nothing less<br/>than Jesus’ blood and righteousness.<br/>I dare not trust the sweetest frame,<br/>but wholly lean on Jesus’ name.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="c1">
      <lines>On Christ the solid rock I stand;<br/>all other ground is sinking sand,<br/>all other ground is sinking sand.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>When Darkness veils his lovely face,<br/>I rest on his unchanging grace.<br/>in every high and stormy gale,<br/>my anchor holds within the veil.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines>His oath, his covenant, his blood<br/>supports me in the whelming flood.<br/>When all around my soul gives way,<br/>he then is all my hope and stay.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v4">
      <lines>When He shall come with trumpet sound,<br/>O may I then in him be found!<br/>Dressed in his righteousness alone,<br/>faultless to stand before the throne.</lines>
    </verse>
