    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>The church’s one foundation<br/>is Jesus Christ her Lord;<br/>she is his new creation<br/>by water and the Word.<br/>From heaven he came and sought her<br/>to be his holy bride;<br/>with his own blood he bought her,<br/>and for her life he died.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>Elect from every nation,<br/>yet one o’er all the earth;<br/>her charter of salvation,<br/>one Lord, one faith, one birth;<br/>one holy name she blesses,<br/>partakes one holy food,<br/>and to one hope she presses,<br/>with every grace endued.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines>Though with a scornful wonder<br/>we see her sore oppressed,<br/>by schisms rent asunder,<br/>by heresies distressed,<br/>yet saints their watch are keeping;<br/>their cry goes up, “How long?”<br/>And soon the night of weeping<br/>shall be the morn of song.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v4">
      <lines>‘Mid toil and tribulation,<br/>and tumult of her war,<br/>she waits the consummation<br/>of peace forevermore;<br/>till, with the vision glorious,<br/>her longing eyes are blest,<br/>and the great church victorious<br/>shall be the church at rest.</lines>
    </verse>
