    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>You that know the Lord is gracious,<br/>You for whom a cornerstone<br/>Stands, of God elect and precious,<br/>Laid that you may build there-on,<br/>See that on that sure foundation<br/>You a living temple raise.<br/>Towers that may tell forth salvation,<br/>Walls that may reech-o praise.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>Living stones by God appointed<br/>Each to his allotted place,<br/>Kings and priests, by God anointed,<br/>Shall you not declare His grace?<br/>You, a royal generation,<br/>Tell the tidings of your birth,<br/>Tidings of a new creation<br/>To an old and weary earth.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines>Tell the praise of Him who called you<br/>Out of darkness into light,<br/>Broke the fetters that enthralled you,<br/>Gave you freedom, peace, and sight:<br/>Tell the tale of sins forgiven,<br/>Strength renewed and hope restored,<br/>Till the earth, in tune with heaven,<br/>Praise and magnify the Lord.</lines>
