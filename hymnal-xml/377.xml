    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>Go forth, go forth with Christ,<br/>Who called you to this day,<br/>He who has led, will lead<br/>And keep you in His way:<br/>His word is fast, His promise sure<br/>To all who serve Him and endure.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>Go forth, go forth with Christ,<br/>With purpose not your own,<br/>Each vict’ry you shall gain<br/>Through Him your Lord alone:<br/>To guard you in fidelity<br/>His Spirit shall your strength’ner be.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines>Go forth, go forth with Christ,<br/>His Priesthood you shall share,<br/>Who bought us by His blood<br/>To be His servants here:<br/>Walk in the way your Savior trod,<br/>Go forth with Him, go forth with God.</lines>
