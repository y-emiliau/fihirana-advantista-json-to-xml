    <verse name="c1">
      <lines>Now is born the divine Christ child,<br/>Play the musette, play the tuneful oboe,<br/>Now is born the divine Christ child,<br/>Sing we all and rejoice this day.</lines>

    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>He was born in a stable bare,<br/>On bed of straw how He sleeps so soundly,<br/>He was born in a stable bare,<br/>Let us worship and to Him bow.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>Ages long since are past and gone,<br/>When the wise men foretold His coming,<br/>Ages long since are past and gone,<br/>When the wise men foretold His birth.</lines>
